Paypal
======

`Paypal <https://www.paypal.com//>` is available and popular worldwide. It doesn’t charge any subscription fee and creating an
account is very easy. That’s why we definitely recommend it for starters in Odoo. It works as a
seamless flow where the customer is routed to Paypal website to register the payment.

Settings in Odoo
================

A production account is needed to get paid with Paypal. Create a `Paypal Production Account
<https://www.paypal.com/us/merchantsignup/applicationChecklist?signupType=CREATE_NEW_ACCOUNT&
productIntentId=wp_standard>`_ or upgrade your personal account to a production account. Go to the
Paypal settings and click on *Upgrade to a production account*.

Then follow the few configuration steps.

.. note::
   Please refer to :ref:`Add a new Payment Acquirer <payment_acquirers/add_new>` to read how to
   enable this payment acquirer on Odoo.

Credentials tab
---------------

Odoo needs your **API Credentials** to connect with your PayPal account, which comprise:

- Email ID: your login email address in Paypal.
- Merchant ID: the code of the merchant account used to identify your Paypal account.
- Use IPN: either you want to use Instant Payment Notification. Already checked, you don't have to
  change it.

You can copy your credentials from your Paypal account, and paste them in the related fields under
the **Credentials** tab.

To retrieve them, log into your Paypal account, and go to :menuselection:`Your account menu -->
Account settings --> Business Profile --> Business Information`

.. important::
   If you are trying Paypal as a test, with a *sandbox account*, change the **State** to *Test
   Mode*. We recommend doing this on a test Odoo database, rather than on your main database.

Configuration tab
-----------------

You can charge extra fees to your customers for paying with Paypal;
This to cover the transaction fees Paypal charges you. Once redirected to Paypal, your customer sees
an extra applied to the order amount.

To activate this, go to the Configuration tab of Paypal configuration in
Odoo and check *Add Extra Fees*.

You can refer to `Paypal Fees <https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees>`__ to set up
fees.

.. note::
   `Traders in the EU <https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/pricing-payments/
   index_en.htm>`_ are not allowed to charge extra fees for paying with credit cards.


Settings in Paypal
==================

First, let’s see how to set up your Paypal account in order to build a seamless customer experience
with Odoo.

Log in and open the settings. Go to :menuselection:`Your account menu --> Account settings -->
Product & Services --> Website payments` and click **Update** on **Website preferences**.

Auto Return
-----------

*Auto Return* automatically redirects your customers to Odoo once the
payment is processed. Check *Auto Return* and enter your domain name
with the suffix ``/shop/confirmation`` as *Return URL*
(e.g. ``https://yourcompany.odoo.com/shop/confirmation``).

This URL is requested in Paypal but not used in practice as Odoo
transmits it at each transaction. Don’t worry if you manage several
sales channels or Odoo databases.

Payment Data Transfer (PDT)
---------------------------

*Payment Data Transfer* delivers the payment confirmation to Odoo as
soon as it is processed. Without it, Odoo cannot end the sales flow.
This setting must be activated as well. When saving, an *Identity
Token* is generated. You will be later requested to enter it in Odoo.

Paypal Account Optional
-----------------------

We advise you to not prompt customers to log in with a Paypal account
when they get to pay. Let them pay with debit/credit cards as well, or you might lose some deals.
Make sure this setting is turned on.

Instant Payment Notification (IPN)
----------------------------------

PDT sends order confirmations once and only once. As a result, your site
must be running when it happens; otherwise, it will never receive the
message. That’s why we advise to activate the *Instant Payment
Notification* (IPN) on top. With IPN, delivery of order confirmations
is virtually guaranteed since IPN resends a confirmation until your site acknowledges receipt.

| To activate IPN, get back to *Website payments* menu and click
  *Update* in *Instant Payment Notification*.
| The *Notification URL* to set is your domain name +
  “payment/paypal/ipn” (e.g. ``https://yourcompany.odoo.com/payment/paypal/ipn``).

Payment Messages Format
-----------------------

If you use accented characters (or anything else than basic Latin characters)
for your customer names, addresses... you MUST configure the encoding format of
the payment request sent by Odoo to Paypal.

.. danger::

    If you don't configure this setting, some transactions fail without notice.

To do so, open:

* `this page for a test account <https://sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/customerprofileweb?cmd=_profile-language-encoding>`__

* `this page for a production account <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/customerprofileweb?cmd=_profile-language-encoding>`__

Then, click *More Options* and set the two default encoding formats as **UTF-8**.

Your Paypal account is ready!

.. tip::
   For Encrypted Website Payments & EWP_SETTINGS error,
   please check the `Paypal documentation <https://developer.paypal.com/docs/
   classic/paypal-payments-standard/integration-guide/encryptedwebpayments/
   #encrypted-website-payments-ewp>`_.

Test environment
================

You can test the entire payment flow in Odoo thanks to Paypal Sandbox accounts.

Log in to `Paypal Developer Site <https://developer.paypal.com/>`__ with your Paypal credentials.

This will create two sandbox accounts:

-  A business account (to use as merchant, e.g. `pp.merch01-facilitator@example.com <mailto:pp.merch01-facilitator@example.com>`__).

-  A default personal account (to use as shopper, e.g. `pp.merch01-buyer@example.com <mailto:pp.merch01-buyer@example.com>`__).

Log in to Paypal Sandbox with the merchant account and follow the same configuration instructions.
Enter your sandbox credentials in Odoo and make sure Paypal is still set on *Test Mode*. We
recommend doing this on a test Odoo database, rather than on your main database.

Run a test transaction from Odoo using the sandbox personal account.
